During second year's summer vacations I took up a anveshan foundation's course on Web development,digital marketing and app development then I found my interest in App invention and through the teacher's guidance I craeted an app named as Chcek your health app.
I used MIT app inventor for making a mobile friendly app in which there are details about how heart beat ,water consumption ,WHR ratio can be monitored for an individual.It uses QR type mechanism for displaying of information on your mobile phone.
Given below is the link to my app:
